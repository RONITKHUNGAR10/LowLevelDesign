The problem was:
Design and implement a Simple document Service where users can create documents and read the same.
A document has a name and associated string content. Document=> <name{string}, content{string}>

All documents are private when created.
Owners of documents can {grant} {read OR edit} access to other users
Only the owner can delete a document
Userna me will be just a string. Every action like create/read/edit/delete must be made on behalf of a user

The interview was for 1 hr 30 min. It took 10-15 mins for introduction and explaining the problem. I had about 1 hr and 15 minutes to design and code. I am sharing the code that I wrote. I used typescript because I was not much confident in c++ (that is what I use for DSA). Please suggest what all could I have done better.
